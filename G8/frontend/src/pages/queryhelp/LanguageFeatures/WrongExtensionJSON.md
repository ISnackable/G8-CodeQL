# JSON in JavaScript file
JSON data should normally be stored in files with extension 'json'. If it is stored in files with extension 'js' or 'jsx' (which are normally associated with JavaScript), developers might attempt to parse or execute the JSON data as JavaScript, which can lead to parse errors.


## Recommendation
Rename the file to have extension 'json'.
