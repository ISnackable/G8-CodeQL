# Exposure of private files
Libraries like `express` provide easy methods for serving entire directories of static files from a web server. However, using these can sometimes lead to accidental information exposure. If for example the `node_modules` folder is served, then an attacker can access the `_where` field from a `package.json` file, which gives access to the absolute path of the file.


## Recommendation
Limit which folders of static files are served from a web server.


## Example
In the example below, all the files from the `node_modules` are served. This allows clients to easily access all the files inside that folder, which includes potentially private information inside `package.json` files.


```javascript

var express = require('express');

var app = express();

app.use('/node_modules', express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, '../node_modules')));
```
The issue has been fixed below by only serving specific folders within the `node_modules` folder.


```javascript

var express = require('express');

var app = express();

app.use("jquery", express.static('./node_modules/jquery/dist'));
app.use("bootstrap", express.static('./node_modules/bootstrap/dist'));
```
