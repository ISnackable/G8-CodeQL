# Missing CSRF middleware
Websites that rely on cookie-based authentication may be vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Specifically, a state-changing request should include a secret token so the request can't be forged by an attacker. Otherwise, unwanted requests can be submitted on behalf of a user who visits a malicious website.

This is typically mitigated by embedding a session-specific secret token in each request. This token is then checked as an additional authentication measure. A malicious website should have no way of guessing the correct token to embed in the request.


## Recommendation
Use a middleware package such as `csurf` to protect against CSRF attacks.


## Example
In the example below, the server authenticates users before performing the `changeEmail` POST action:


```javascript
var app = require("express")(),
  cookieParser = require("cookie-parser"),
  passport = require("passport");

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(passport.authorize({ session: true }));

app.post("/changeEmail", function(req, res) {
  let newEmail = req.cookies["newEmail"];
  // ...
});

```
This is not secure. An attacker can submit a POST `changeEmail` request on behalf of a user who visited a malicious website. Since authentication happens without any action from the user, the `changeEmail` action would be executed, despite not being initiated by the user.

This vulnerability can be mitigated by installing a CSRF protecting middleware handler:


```javascript
var app = require("express")(),
  cookieParser = require("cookie-parser"),
  passport = require("passport"),
  csrf = require("csurf");

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(passport.authorize({ session: true }));
app.use(csrf({ cookie: true }));
app.post("/changeEmail", function(req, res) {
  let newEmail = req.cookies["newEmail"];
  // ...
});

```
