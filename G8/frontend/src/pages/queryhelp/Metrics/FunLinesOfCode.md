# Lines of code in functions
This metric measures the number of lines of code in a function, excluding comments and blank lines.

Having too many lines of code in a function is an indication that it can be split into several functions of more manageable size.


## Recommendation
Long functions should be examined to see if they can be split into smaller, more cohesive functions.
