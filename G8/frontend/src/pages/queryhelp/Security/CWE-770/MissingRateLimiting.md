# Missing rate limiting
HTTP request handlers should not perform expensive operations such as accessing the file system, executing an operating system command or interacting with a database without limiting the rate at which requests are accepted. Otherwise, the application becomes vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks where an attacker can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive by issuing a large number of requests at the same time.


## Recommendation
A rate-limiting middleware should be used to prevent such attacks.


## Example
The following example shows an Express application that serves static files without rate limiting:


```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/:path', function(req, res) {
  let path = req.params.path;
  if (isValidPath(path))
    res.sendFile(path);
});

```
To prevent denial-of-service attacks, the `express-rate-limit` package can be used:


```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

// set up rate limiter: maximum of five requests per minute
var RateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
var limiter = new RateLimit({
  windowMs: 1*60*1000, // 1 minute
  max: 5
});

// apply rate limiter to all requests
app.use(limiter);

app.get('/:path', function(req, res) {
  let path = req.params.path;
  if (isValidPath(path))
    res.sendFile(path);
});

```
