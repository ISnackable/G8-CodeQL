# Client-side URL redirect
Redirecting to a URL that is constructed from parts of the DOM that may be controlled by an attacker can facilitate phishing attacks. In these attacks, unsuspecting users can be redirected to a malicious site that looks very similar to the real site they intend to visit, but which is controlled by the attacker.


## Recommendation
To guard against untrusted URL redirection, it is advisable to avoid putting user input directly into a redirect URL. Instead, maintain a list of authorized redirects on the server; then choose from that list based on the user input provided.


## Example
The following example uses a regular expression to extract a query parameter from the document URL, and then uses it to construct a new URL to redirect to without any further validation. This may allow an attacker to craft a link that redirects from a trusted website to some arbitrary website of their choosing, which facilitates phishing attacks:


```javascript
window.location = /.*redirect=([^&]*).*/.exec(document.location.href)[1];

```
