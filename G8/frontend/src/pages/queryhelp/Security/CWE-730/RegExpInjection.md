# Regular expression injection
Constructing a regular expression with unsanitized user input is dangerous as a malicious user may be able to modify the meaning of the expression. In particular, such a user may be able to provide a regular expression fragment that takes exponential time in the worst case, and use that to perform a Denial of Service attack.


## Recommendation
Before embedding user input into a regular expression, use a sanitization function such as lodash's `_.escapeRegExp` to escape meta-characters that have special meaning.


## Example
The following example shows a HTTP request parameter that is used to construct a regular expression without sanitizing it first:


```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/findKey', function(req, res) {
  var key = req.param("key"), input = req.param("input");

  // BAD: Unsanitized user input is used to construct a regular expression
  var re = new RegExp("\\b" + key + "=(.*)\n");
});

```
Instead, the request parameter should be sanitized first, for example using the function `_.escapeRegExp` from the lodash package. This ensures that the user cannot insert characters which have a special meaning in regular expressions.


```javascript
var express = require('express');
var _ = require('lodash');
var app = express();

app.get('/findKey', function(req, res) {
  var key = req.param("key"), input = req.param("input");

  // GOOD: User input is sanitized before constructing the regex
  var safeKey = _.escapeRegExp(key);
  var re = new RegExp("\\b" + safeKey + "=(.*)\n");
});

```
