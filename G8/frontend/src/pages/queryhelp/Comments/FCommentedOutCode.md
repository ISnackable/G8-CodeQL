# Lines of commented-out code in files
This metric counts the number of lines of commented-out code in each file. Large amounts of commented-out code often indicate poorly maintained code.


## Example
In the following example, a `console.log` method call, perhaps originally used for debugging, is left in the code, but commented out. It should be removed altogether.


```javascript
function area(r) {
	// console.log("Got r: " + r);
	return r.length * r.width;
}
```
