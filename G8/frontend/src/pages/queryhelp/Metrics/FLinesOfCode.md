# Lines of code in files
There are a number of problems associated with a high number of lines of code:

* It can be difficult to understand and maintain, even with good tool support.
* It increases the likelihood of multiple developers needing to work on the same file at once, and it therefore increases the likelihood of merge conflicts.
* It may increase network traffic if you use a version control system that requires the whole file to be transmitted even for a tiny change.
* It may arise as a result of bundling many unrelated things into the same file, and so it can indicate weak code organization.

## Recommendation
The solution depends on the reason for the high number of lines:

* If the file contains one or more very large functions, you should decompose them into smaller functions by means of the Extract Function refactoring.
* If the file contains many smaller functions, you should try to split up the file into multiple smaller files.
* If the file has been automatically generated by a tool, no changes are required because the file will not be maintained by a programmer.
