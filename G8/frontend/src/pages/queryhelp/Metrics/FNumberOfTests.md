# Number of tests
This metric measures how many tests each file contains. By default, the query recognizes QUnit tests, xUnit.js facts, and BDD-style tests as used by frameworks such as Jasmine, Mocha and Unit.js.


## Recommendation
This metric can be used to identify parts of the code base that have very few tests and could perhaps benefit from more thorough testing.
